# Intro

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## File structure
All files about GraphQL (schema, query) are in graphql folder.

All files about React hooks are in hooks folder.

The rest follows the structure made by create-next-app command.

## GraphQL codegen
Schema file is generated by @graphql-codegen/cli package.

Config is in codegen.yml file. Since all GraphQL queries are inside graphql folder, it only needs to specify graphql folder as documents parameter.
